## Project Description
This is the Backend API for the VIVA Graduation Project. It acts as an intelligent engine that simulates a university project discussion (Viva). The system allows students to upload their project documentation, generates relevant discussion questions using **Google's Gemini AI**, and evaluates student answers with grading and feedback.

## Key Features
* **Document Parsing:** Extracts text from project files (supports .pdf and .docx).
* **AI Question Generation:** Uses NLP (Gemini Pro) to analyze project content and generate diverse questions (factual, analytical, explanatory).
* **Automated Grading:** Compares student answers against model answers and provides a score (0-10) with constructive feedback.
* **High Performance:** Built with **FastAPI** for asynchronous processing and high speed.
* **Swagger Documentation:** Interactive API documentation for easy testing and integration.

## Tech Stack
* **Framework:** FastAPI
* **Language:** Python 3.10
* **AI Model:** Google Generative AI (Gemini 2.5 Flash)
* **File Handling:** PyPDF2, python-docx
* **Deployment:** Railway

    {
      "status": "success",
      "questions": [
        "What is the main objective of the platform?",
        "How does the AI model handle Arabic dialects?",
        "Explain the architecture used in this project."
      ]
    }
    ```

### 2. Evaluate Student Answers
* **Endpoint:** `POST /evaluate`
* **Description:** Grades the student's answers based on the previously uploaded project.

    ```json
    {
      "student_answers": [
        "The objective is to help students simluate exams...",
        "It uses NLP models to process text...",
        "The architecture consists of a client-server model..."
      ]
    }
    ```
* **Response Example:**
    ```json
    {
      "status": "success",
      "evaluation": [
